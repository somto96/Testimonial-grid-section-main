## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I had a better understanding of CSS Grid and pseudo-classes like :nth-of-type(). It also helped me remember some HTML5 tags like header and footer. I tend to forget about tags like header, footer, nav etc. during development. I always used a lot of div tags but this challenge was an eye opener. 

### Useful resources
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - It helped me out with some of my CSS issues during development.
